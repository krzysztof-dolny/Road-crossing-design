# Road crossing design
By using PLC siemens 1212c ac/dc/rly and HMI we want to create a visualization of
intersection of Baraniaka and Jana Pawła II streets in Poznań. Code is wrote in LAD in Tia Portal v13. There are implemented functionalities such as: 
- support for pedestrian buttons
- induction loops
- emergency mode
- priority road service

Visualization at HMI screen looks like this:

We also want to create a WEB Server where we also could watch the visualization but it's not working for now and it's still in progress.
